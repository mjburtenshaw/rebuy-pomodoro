### Documentation

- Update appropriate **DOCFILES**, e.g., `README` or `TECHNOLOGIES`, if changelogs modify how developers can interact with the application, such as modifying scripts. In all such cases, also update the version symbols in this document, [`package.json`](package.json), and [`package-lock.json`](package-lock.json).
- Update the `version` property in [`client/package.json`](client/package.json) and [`client/package-lock.json`](client/package-lock.json) when modifying how users can interact with the client.
- All **DOCFILES** should be referenced in this document to improve discoverability.

### Version Control

- Adhere to [the Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Adhere to [the Semantic Versioning specification](https://semver.org).
