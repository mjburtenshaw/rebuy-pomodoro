## Core Technologies

- [**React**](https://react.dev): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used as the primary UI library in this project.

## Development Tools

- [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org): A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It's extendable and configurable, ensuring code quality and consistency.
- [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io): A code formatter to ensure consistent style.
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org): An open-source language which builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions, aiming to improve the development and maintainability of large JavaScript codebases.
- [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev): A modern frontend build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It's faster than traditional tools like Webpack because it minimizes bundling during development.
