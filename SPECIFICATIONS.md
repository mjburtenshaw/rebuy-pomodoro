# Project: Pomodoro Timer

## Overview

The Pomodoro Technique is a popular time management method for boosting productivity and focus.  Build a web-based Pomodoro timer application to help users implement this technique. Spend as much time or as little as you need to prepare the following. 

## Core Features

- **Customizable Timers**: Allow users to set the length of their work sessions (Pomodoros) and break periods (short and long breaks).
- **Sound Notifications**: Play sound alerts to indicate when to switch between work and break periods. A selection of different sounds would be a plus.
- **Progress Tracking**: Provide a simple visual tracker (e.g., a circle filling in) to show progress through the current Pomodoro session.

## Stretch Goals (Optional)

- **Task Listing**: Let users add a task description for each Pomodoro session.
- **History/Statistics**: Store completed session data to display simple statistics on the user's work patterns over time.
- **Theme Customization**: Allow users to change color schemes or light/dark mode.

## Technical Considerations

- **React**: Naturally, we'd expect the developer to use React for the application's structure.
- **State Management**: Consider how state is managed for timer settings, current work/break status, and any tracked history.
- **Sound Handling**: Think about how to incorporate sound playing functionality.

## Deliverables

- High Level pseudo-code
- Brief project overview
- Setup instructions
- Explanation of design choices and unique features

## The Goal

We're less interested in a pixel-perfect, full-featured Pomodoro app and more in getting insights into a developer's:

- **React Proficiency**: How do they structure components, handle state, and write clean code?
- **Problem-Solving**: What's their approach to breaking down tasks and handling timer logic?
- **Creativity**: Did they go beyond the basics with unique features or clever implementations?
